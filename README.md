<h1 align="center">👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!</h1>

Hello! I’m Niranjan Bhatta, a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Currently in my 3rd year, I’m exploring a variety of AI applications through personal and academic projects.

<h2 align="center">🛠️ My Projects</h2>

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:
### 1. **Extraction and Organization of Data from CVs** 
 - The project extracts Name, Email, Phone-number skills, experience, and projects from CVs using OCR and NLP, categorizing the data into key sections. It then compares the CV data with user-provided prompts using cosine similarity and ranks the CVs based on combined similarity scores through linear regression.
### 2. **Movie Genre Classification**
- A model that classifies movies into genres based on their descriptions.
### 3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
- A model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
